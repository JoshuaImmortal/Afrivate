          <p className="text-gray-600">
            DeepPay holds payments in escrow to ensure that the agreed amount is funded by the Employer before starting work. When DeepPay is funded, the Freelancer can feel confident that funds are available, and the Employer feels secure that work can be reviewed before making the payment. DeepPay helps create transparency on the platform.

An Employer can pay for tasks, milestones, hours, miscellaneous work, or even bonuses. Funds can be released to either the Employer or the Freelancer in the case of a disagreement, either party can request Arbitration, as long as funds are available in DeepPay.
